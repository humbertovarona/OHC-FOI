# OHC-FOI

An algorithm for Computing the Ocean Heat Content

# Descripion

Two Matlab algorithms are presented to compute the Ocean Heat Content by the trapezoidal method, using the variable specific heat and density at the ocean surface. One of the algorithms allows computing the Ocean Heat Content through a fractional order integral.

**Algorithm 1**: Computes Ocean Heat Content using a fractional order integral.

**Algorithm 2**: Computes Ocean Heat Content
